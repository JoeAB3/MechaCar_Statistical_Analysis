# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Jeremy has been approached to review production data for the new MechaCar
Jermey has been asked to preform regression analysis to identify:
1) which variables that predict mpg
2) collect summary statistics  on PSI of the suspension coils from manufacturing lots
3) run t-tests to determine if the manfacturing lots are statistically different from general population
4) Finally, design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance for the MechaCar against competitive vehicles
